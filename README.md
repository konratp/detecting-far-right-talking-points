# Detecting-Far-Right-Talking-Points
GitHub Repository for the Final Project for Le Wagon's Data Science Bootcamp Batch 1014 in Berlin. We're attempting to build a deep learning model that detects far-right talking points in non-far-right politicians' speeches, tracking the rightward-shift of the Overton Window in European politics over time.
